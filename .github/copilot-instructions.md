# Copilot instructions for this Astro portfolio

## Project architecture
- Astro site with file-based routing in src/pages. List pages live in src/pages/blog/index.astro and src/pages/projects/index.astro; dynamic detail pages are src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro and src/pages/projects/[...slug].astro.
- Content is managed via Astro Content Collections in src/content (blog and projects). The schema lives in src/content.config.ts and is used by getCollection() and render().
- Layouts in src/layouts (BlogPost.astro, ProjectPost.astro) provide the page chrome and expect props that match the collection schema (title, description, pubDate, updatedDate, heroImage).
- Shared site chrome and metadata are centralized: BaseHead.astro injects global CSS and SEO/OpenGraph/RSS metadata; Header.astro and Footer.astro render navigation and social links.
- RSS feeds are generated by API routes at src/pages/rss-blog.xml.js and src/pages/rss-projects.xml.js using @astrojs/rss.

## Critical workflows
- Dev server: npm run dev (http://localhost:4321)
- Production build: npm run build
- Preview build: npm run preview

## Project-specific conventions
- Global CSS is only imported in BaseHead.astro; all pages should use <BaseHead /> to inherit base styles.
- Navigation links use HeaderLink.astro which applies an active class based on Astro.url.pathname.
- Content list pages sort by pubDate descending before rendering cards.
- The site title/description are centralized in src/consts.ts and used across pages and RSS feeds.
- Homepage includes Vercel analytics components (SpeedInsights and Analytics) in src/pages/index.astro.

## Content authoring patterns
- Markdown/MDX files live under src/content/blog and src/content/projects with frontmatter fields matching the schema in src/content.config.ts.
- heroImage paths are used directly in list/detail views; store assets in public/ and reference with absolute paths (e.g., /blog-placeholder-1.jpg).

## Integration points
- Astro integrations configured in astro.config.mjs: MDX and sitemap; site URL is https://teo-dev.com.
- RSS feeds are exposed at /rss-blog.xml and /rss-projects.xml.
