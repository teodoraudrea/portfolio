## Overview
I partnered with internal stakeholders and a third-party vendor to deliver an accommodation
application portal that met strict usability, accessibility, and contractual requirements.

## Highlights
- Acted as the main liaison between the university’s Residential Business Services and the vendor.
- Ensured accessibility requirements (AAA compliance) and functional scope were met.
- Contributed hands-on to .NET development to recover timelines and reduce delivery risk.

## Outcomes
The portal shipped with improved accessibility coverage, clearer governance, and reduced delivery
risk through proactive project leadership.
