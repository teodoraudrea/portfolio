## Overview
I led the redevelopment of the university’s digital pattern library, replacing outdated tooling and
creating a foundation for long-term maintainability and governance.

## Highlights
- Established a new tech stack (Astro, Vite, Algolia DocSearch) aligned with modern standards.
- Built CI/CD pipelines and documentation to support internal and external contributors.
- Delivered technical evaluations to stakeholders to ensure cost-effective, future-proof decisions.

## Outcomes
The refreshed pattern library supports faster delivery, consistent UI standards, and clearer
documentation for multiple teams.
